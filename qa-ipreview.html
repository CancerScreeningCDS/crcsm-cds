 (SMART          <sup>&reg;</sup>
) standard
facilitates the integration of software applications, or "apps," with
health IT systems. "SMART on FHIR apps," or sometimes simply "SMART
apps," are software applications that securely interact with patient
EHRs and other healthcare-related data via a FHIR API. SMART apps are
interoperable in the sense that they can interface with any health IT
system that supports the SMART standard and the data requirements of the
app. Instead of writing a separate software application to provide the
same capability for each different health IT system, a single
application can be written that works with many different health IT
systems.

Reference Implementation is an open source software package written in
the Java programming language. It has been used to translate the CRCSM
CDS CQL, which as a by-product checks the CQL for conformance to the CQL
specification. As with the FHIR Validator, this tool checks to make sure
what has been written is, from a software standpoint, "grammatically
correct." It does not provide any insight into whether the CQL code, as
written, correctly implements the intended CDS logic.

Once CQL code has been translated into a computer friendly format, it
additionally needs software to "execute" or "run" the result in the
context of a patient's electronic health record. Executing CQL in this
way is necessary to support both Unit and End-to-End Testing. Multiple
open-source CQL "execution engines" exist; the CRCSM CDS has been unit
tested using the           <a href="https://github.com/cqframework/cql-execution" target="_blank">CQL Execution
Framework</a>
 Reference
Implementation, a software library written in the JavaScript programming
language. Additional JavaScript libraries are used to help interface
with           <a href="https://github.com/cqframework/cql-exec-fhir" target="_blank">FHIR data</a>
 and to
handle           <a href="https://github.com/cqframework/cql-exec-vsac" target="_blank">clinical codes and value
sets</a>
. For End-to-End
Testing, an asynchronous library called           <a href="https://github.com/asbi-cds-tools/cql-worker" target="_blank">CQL
Workers</a>
 is used for
computational speed reasons.

The           <a href="https://github.com/asbi-cds-tools/cql-worker" target="_blank">CQL Testing
Framework</a>
 is a JavaScript
software library that facilitates Unit Testing of CQL code. While
leveraging the CQL Execution Framework Reference Implementation, it
provides a convenient short-hand notation for defining test cases. The
CQL Testing Framework also automates the process of running the test
cases, which greatly increases the efficiency of TDD of CDS. All Unit
Tests were developed through the use of the CQL Testing Framework. The
complete specifications for all test cases were released under an
open-source license.

 is a software
library written in the JavaScript programming language that implements
the FHIR $apply operation. It has been developed for the specific
purpose of testing the CRCSM CDS but is also general in that it can be
used with other CDS. The name "Encender," which is also the Spanish word
for "to light or turn on," was chosen because the software allows FHIR
resources representing CDS to be applied to a specific patient's
electronic health data. As shown in Figure 2 and discussed in           <a href="#conceptual-cds-usage" target="_blank">Section 3.3.4</a>
, 
the output from the FHIR $apply operation, and thus the Encender
library, includes the CDS recommended actions for a specific patient.
This makes Encender a critical tool for End-to-End Testing; it uses the
CQL Workers library for CQL code execution. Encender has been released
as open source software.
