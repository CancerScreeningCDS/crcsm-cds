Tests and intervals are as per average risk screening recommendations.\n* If relative diagnosed at < 60 years old:\n    * Start screening 10 years before relative's age at diagnosis or age 40, whichever is earlier. Repeat colonoscopy every 5 years.\n    * If no significant neoplasia appears by age 60 years, can offer expanding the interval between colonoscopies.\n\nFor patients with 2 or more first-degree relatives with colorectal cancer or an advanced polyp:\n* Start screening colonoscopy 10 years before the reatives' youngest age at diagnosis or age 40, whichever is earlier. Repeat colonoscopy every 5 years.\n\nPatients with a history of potentially precancerous polyps should follow shortest interval between recommendations above and recommendations based on colonoscopy findings.",
