### Terminology

This implementation guide draws on a number of formal terminologies (code systems). Several guiding principles were applied in selecting terminologies:

* Fit for purpose
* Conformance with FHIR
* Use in real world practice

Terminologies used throughout this implementation guide include SNOMED CT, ICD-10-CM, LOINC, and UCUM.

When possible, existing terminology content was used.

#### Value sets used by knowledge artifacts in this guide

This implementation guide uses externally defined value sets sourced from the [Value Set Authority Center (VSAC)](https://vsac.nlm.nih.gov/), including reuse of value sets created and maintained by other organizations.

When no fit-for-purpose value sets existed, new value sets were created (see [Value Sets](artifacts.html#terminology-value-sets)).

#### Local code systems

When no existing codes were identified in existing terminologies, local code systems were defined. A complete list of code systems defined within this implementation guide is available [here](artifacts.html#terminology-code-systems).
